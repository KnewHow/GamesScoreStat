# Games101 Homework Score Statistics

a little code to help split score and combine socre. If you have completed a homework statistics work, named with `HWX` **X** is the number of the homework, then put the file into the `score` directory. If all combine_single homework have completed, I will combine all combine_single homework into a final excel file.
